# BankTools_AI - Advanced Machine Learning Models

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements **two advanced machine learning models** using modern ML techniques with `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. The loan model features **SelectKBest feature selection** and **multiple classifier comparison** for optimal performance.

## 📊 Models Implemented

### 1. 🔄 Churn Prediction Model (`churn_model.py`)
**Purpose**: Predict customer churn risk for banking employees  
**Dataset**: `Churn_Modelling.csv`  
**Target**: `Exited` (1 = churned, 0 = stayed)  

**Features**:
- **Dropped**: `RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, `Surname`
- **One-hot encoded**: `Geography`, `Gender`  
- **Normalized**: `Age`, `Balance`, `EstimatedSalary`, `CreditScore`, `Tenure`
- **Data split**: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test

### 2. 🏦 Loan Approval Model (`loan_model.py`)
**Purpose**: Predict loan approval probability with advanced feature selection  
**Dataset**: `Loan Approval Training Dataset.csv`  
**Target**: `Loan_Status` (Y=1, N=0)  

**Advanced Features**:
- **SelectKBest feature selection**: Automatically selects top 5 most important features
- **Multiple classifier comparison**: Tests RandomForest, GradientBoosting, and LogisticRegression
- **Feature alignment**: Maps original dataset features to frontend form fields
- **Synthetic feature generation**: Creates realistic features from available data
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold CV for robust model selection
- **Performance**: 98% ROC-AUC, 90% accuracy

**Selected Features** (top 5):
1. `income` (combined applicant + co-applicant income)
2. `employment_years` (derived from income and education)
3. `credit_score` (derived from Credit_History and other factors)
4. `ApplicantIncome` (original feature)
5. `Credit_History` (original feature)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Loan Model Pipeline
```python
Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('feature_selection', SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=5)),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())  # Best performing model
])
```

### Key Innovations
- ✅ **Automatic feature selection** using SelectKBest
- ✅ **Model comparison** with cross-validation
- ✅ **Feature alignment** between training data and frontend form
- ✅ **Synthetic data generation** for missing features
- ✅ **Intelligent fallback system** (AI → Enhanced Rules → Basic Rules)
- ✅ **98% ROC-AUC performance**
- ✅ **Real-time predictions** with comprehensive recommendations
