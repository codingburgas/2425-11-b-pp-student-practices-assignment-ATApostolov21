# User Data Isolation Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented to ensure that every user of the web application can only access their own data, with complete isolation between users.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Database Model Security
- **LoanRequest Model**: Has a `user_id` foreign key that links each loan application to a specific user
- **ChurnAnalysis Model**: Has an `employee_id` foreign key that links each churn analysis to a specific banking employee
- All sensitive data is stored with proper user association

### 2. API Endpoint Security

#### User Loan Applications (`/user/` endpoints)
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require `@login_required` decorator
- **Role-Based Access**: Only users with `banking_user` role can access loan endpoints
- **Data Filtering**: All database queries filter by `user_id=current_user.id`

Key Endpoints:
- `POST /user/loan-request` - Submit loan application (creates with current_user.id)
- `GET /user/loan-requests` - Get all loan requests for current user only
- `GET /user/loan-request/<id>` - Get specific loan request (filtered by user_id)
- `DELETE /user/loan-request/<id>` - Delete loan request (filtered by user_id)

#### Churn Analysis (`/admin/` endpoints)
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require `@login_required` decorator
- **Role-Based Access**: Only users with `banking_employee` role can access churn endpoints
- **Data Filtering**: All database queries filter by `employee_id=current_user.id`

Key Endpoints:
- `POST /admin/churn-upload` - Upload churn analysis (creates with current_user.id)
- `GET /admin/churn-analyses` - Get all churn analyses for current employee only
- `GET /admin/churn-analysis/<id>` - Get specific analysis (filtered by employee_id)
- `DELETE /admin/churn-analysis/<id>` - Delete analysis (filtered by employee_id)

### 3. Frontend Security

#### API Client Security
- All API calls go through authenticated endpoints
- No localStorage usage for persistent data - everything stored in database
- Proper error handling for 401/403 responses

#### Component Security
- Components fetch data from backend APIs instead of localStorage
- User context ensures only authenticated users can access features
- Error boundaries handle unauthorized access gracefully

### 4. Database Query Security

All database queries follow the pattern:
```python
# Correct - filters by current user
Model.query.filter_by(user_id=current_user.id)

# Incorrect - would expose all data
Model.query.all()  # Never used for user data
```

### 5. Access Control Matrix

| Resource Type | User Role | Access Level | Security Filter |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Loan Applications | banking_user | Own data only | `user_id=current_user.id` |
| Churn Analysis | banking_employee | Own data only | `employee_id=current_user.id` |
| User Account | Any authenticated | Own account only | `id=current_user.id` |

### 6. Security Verification

#### Backend Verification Points
1. **Authentication**: Flask-Login session management
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **Data Isolation**: User-specific database filtering
4. **Input Validation**: Proper data validation on all endpoints

#### Frontend Verification Points
1. **Route Protection**: Authentication required for protected routes
2. **API Security**: All data fetched from authenticated endpoints
3. **Error Handling**: Proper handling of unauthorized access
4. **State Management**: No cross-user data leakage

### 7. Implementation Details

#### New Endpoints Added
- `GET /user/loan-requests` - Retrieve user's loan applications
- `GET /user/loan-request/<id>` - Get specific loan application details
- `DELETE /user/loan-request/<id>` - Delete specific loan application

#### Updated Components
- `LoanDashboard.tsx` - Now fetches from database instead of localStorage
- `LoanRequestForm.tsx` - Removed localStorage dependency
- `LoanDetails.tsx` - New component for viewing loan details from database

### 8. Security Testing

To verify security implementation:

1. **User Isolation Test**: Create two users, submit loan applications with each, verify they cannot see each other's data
2. **Role Isolation Test**: Verify banking users cannot access churn analysis endpoints
3. **Employee Isolation Test**: Create two employees, upload churn analyses, verify they cannot see each other's analyses
4. **Direct API Test**: Attempt to access other users' data by modifying request IDs - should return 404

### 9. Potential Security Considerations

- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with Flask-Login
- **CSRF Protection**: CORS properly configured for frontend-backend communication
- **SQL Injection**: Using SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
- **Data Validation**: Input validation on all endpoints

## Conclusion

The implemented security measures ensure complete data isolation between users:
- Users can only see and modify their own loan applications
- Employees can only see and modify their own churn analyses
- All database queries are properly filtered by user/employee ID
- Frontend components respect backend security boundaries
- No localStorage dependency for persistent data prevents client-side data leakage
