# AI Models Organization

## Overview
The AI models in the BankTools_AI application have been reorganized into a clean, modular structure for better maintainability and development efficiency.

## New Directory Structure

## Module Descriptions

### Churn Module (`churn/`)
- **Purpose**: Customer churn prediction and related functionality
- **Main Class**: `ChurnPredictor` - Clean, modular churn prediction model
- **Features**: 
  - Enhanced data quality assessment
  - Comprehensive validation rules
  - Customer retention insights
  - Risk level assessment

### Loan Module (`loan/`)
- **Purpose**: Loan approval prediction and risk assessment
- **Main Class**: `LoanPredictor` - Clean, modular loan prediction model
- **Features**:
  - Frontend-to-model data conversion
  - Risk assessment utilities
  - Personalized loan recommendations
  - Credit score evaluation

### Shared Module (`shared/`)
- **Purpose**: Reusable utilities across all AI models
- **Components**:
  - `BasePredictor`: Abstract base class for all models
  - `LogisticRegression`: Custom implementation from scratch
  - `ModelEvaluator`: Binary classification evaluation metrics
  - `DataUtils`: Common data processing utilities
  - `DataValidator`: Comprehensive data validation
  - `DataCleaner`: Enhanced data cleaning with quality scoring
  - `ChurnFeatureEngineer`: Churn-specific feature creation
  - `LoanFeatureEngineer`: Loan data alignment with frontend
  - `DataQualityAssessment`: Quality assessment and reporting
  - `EnhancedDataCleaner`: Configurable cleaning strategies

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modularity**
- Separate concerns into focused modules
- Reusable components across different models
- Easy to test individual components

### 2. **Maintainability**
- Clear organization and structure
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation

### 3. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new model types
- Shared utilities reduce code duplication
- Clean separation of model-specific and general functionality

### 4. **Development Experience**
- Clear import paths
- Logical file organization
- Better code navigation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Model Usage
```python
from app.ai_models import ChurnPredictor, LoanPredictor

# Churn prediction
churn_model = ChurnPredictor()
results = churn_model.train("datasets/Churn_Modelling.csv")
prediction = churn_model.predict(customer_data)

# Loan prediction  
loan_model = LoanPredictor()
results = loan_model.train("datasets/loan_data.csv")
prediction = loan_model.predict(loan_application)
```

### Using Shared Components
```python
from app.ai_models.shared import DataCleaner, ChurnFeatureEngineer

# Data cleaning
cleaner = DataCleaner()
cleaned_data, report = cleaner.comprehensive_clean(df)

# Feature engineering
engineer = ChurnFeatureEngineer()
enhanced_data = engineer.create_churn_features(df)
```

### Direct Module Imports
```python
from app.ai_models.churn import ChurnPredictor
from app.ai_models.loan import LoanPredictor
from app.ai_models.shared import DataValidator, ModelEvaluator
```

## Backward Compatibility

The reorganization maintains full backward compatibility:
- All existing API endpoints continue to work
- Same model interfaces (`train()`, `predict()`, `save_model()`, `load_model()`)
- Import paths updated but original functionality preserved
- Original deprecated models removed for cleaner codebase

## Files Removed

The following deprecated files were removed during reorganization:
- `churn_model.py` (replaced by `churn/churn_model_clean.py`)
- `loan_model.py` (replaced by `loan/loan_model_clean.py`)

## Benefits

1. **Better Code Organization**: Logical separation of concerns
2. **Improved Readability**: Clear module structure and purpose
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Easier to modify and extend
4. **Reduced Complexity**: Smaller, focused files instead of monoliths
5. **Increased Reusability**: Shared utilities across models
6. **Better Testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
7. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new models and features

This new organization provides a solid foundation for continued development of the BankTools_AI machine learning capabilities while maintaining clean, professional code standards.
